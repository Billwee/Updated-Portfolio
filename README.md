# My Portfolio

This is my updated portfolio. I've completely changed the design into a single page layout and added a better visual concept and a little personalization.

## New Additions

- The initial background photo is a photo of my desk and set up at home where I write all of my code.

- I've included a typewriter effect I learned from a YouTube tutorial created by Brad Traversy - [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POX3dT-pB4E)

- I implemented a smooth scrolling script for navigating the page. Code for that forked from Chris Ferdinandi's GitHub repo - [Link Here](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)

- The CSS animations are from an HTML/CSS class on Udemy.com taught by Brad Traversy. I can't link directly to the video because it's a paid course that you can't access without purchase.

- I've linked to my Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter accounts.

* Lastly, I've added a link to access my resume hosted on Dropbox.
